## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### In this dataset we can see that couple of these variables had a non random variance to the MPG. Those variables are the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and the AWD. On this database we can see that the linear model is not considered to be zero because it is 5.35e-11 which is slightly above zero. We can tell by looking at the results that it does accurately predict the mpg of Mechacar's protoype correctly. We know this because of the results of the p value. Since it's above zero we can tell that this one was correct. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### To answer this question we can check our Lot Summary and we can see that Lot 1 and Lot 2 are both under 100 pounds per square inch. However Lot 3 does exceed 100 pounds at 170 pounds. However when we check the Suspension Summary it is at 62 pounds. We can see that even though Lot 3 is above 100 pounds it does not bring up the total over the 100 pounds per sqare inch. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### My interpetation of the t tests results is that Lot 1 is the only Lot to be at the mean of 1500 while Lot 2 is above 1500 and Lot 3 is below 1500. This is can be shown when we check the results of these codes. I take this as being that a majority of Lot 2 and Lot 3 are either slightly above or below the PSI of 1500 to get these results and this can be confirmed when we check the database. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

For this I would study the maintenance cost of the vehicles. For this study the hypothesis would be how much the maintenance cost would be for the vehicle over time. The statiscal test needed for this would be to run a linear regression to run to see what the maintenance cost could be on the vehicles. We could do this to predict how much the cost of the maintenance on these specific vehicles are. Another test to run would be a T-Test on what breaks down on these vehicles. This test would be greatly help the buyers on what starts to deteriorate fastest on these vehicles.
